# Test Scenario 5: FULL SYNC + LC DELETE - 5 versioned buckets
# PHASE 1 - Full sync: Stop sync services → Write all to primary → Restart sync → Verify full sync
# PHASE 2 - LC delete: Stop ALL RGW → LC delete on primary → Monitor deletion → Restart ALL RGW → Monitor sync
# Create 1.3M objects/bkt with 5 versions each (all 2 bytes), then delete via lifecycle
# Total Data: ~65MB, Total Objects: 6.5Million (logical)
# Total versions: 32.5Million
# NOTE: LC deletion is actively monitored every 30s until all objects are deleted (max 3 hours)
